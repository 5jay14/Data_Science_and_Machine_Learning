This repository contains the work I did while learning ML and Data Science through Udemy course and self-practice.
The goal was to gain a strong foundation in supervised and unsupervised learning by implementing core algorithms from scratch and experimenting with real datasets.

What’s Inside:
Data Science Concepts
 Supervised Learning
 Linear Regression
 Logistic Regression
 KNN 
 Tree Based Methods(Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient and ADA Boosting)
 SVM
 Naïve Bayes
 
 Unsupervised Learning
 K-Means
 Hierarchical - clustering
 DBSCAN

Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib
