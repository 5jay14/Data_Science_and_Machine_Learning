Directory - Folder

Repository - where project/files/folder/code is stored

Git - tool used to track the changes in the code
GitHub is a Website to host the repository online
CD - change directory

add -  track the files and changes in Git
commit - save the change in files in Git

I am changing something for better


1st 
Generating a SSH key

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "vijayprat5@gmail.com"

-t rsa = type of encryption
-b 4096 = strength of encryption


to view the keys
ls | grep <name of the key>

to view of the content of the key
cat <name of the key>


to ensure SSH has enabled locally
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 232



2nd
Local git CLI should know that we have generated a key

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Identity added: /c/Users/91889/.ssh/id_rsa (vijayprat5@gmail.com)




1st 
We can download the remote repo to local machine using IDE terminal 
git clone git@github.com:5jay14/intro.md.git

2nd
change into that directory/folder

3rd
to know the status of file, if it is being tracked or no
git status

4th
to track the files

git add 
//file/folder name

git add . 
//this will add everything


4th
save the code locally

git commit -m "title of the message what and why" -m "some description"

5th
in order to push the code to remote repository
git push
